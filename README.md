# Drug Response Project

This project, a continuation of my work with Dr. Anuj Karpatne and Md Abdullah Al Maruf, aims to use the drug-response data on bacterial cells [4] and attempts to utilize the drug-protein and protein-protein interaction networks extracted from [1] such that we could use state-of-the-art graph Machine Learning algorithms [2,3] that could help us better predict the drug-responses given the structural embeddings we learn through the protein interaction networks of the drugs. In essence, [4] and many others have attempted to predict drug-responses solely based on data from lab-based experiments without taking into consideration the fact that certain proteins that these drugs act on can give us valuable structural information that might help us make better predictions on the drug-responses.

## Introduction to the dataset

For this project, we utilize the dataset from [4] which consists of drugs Chloramphenicol, Doxycycline, Erythromycin, Lincomycin, Ofloxacin, Salicylate, and Trimethoprim. The dataset, curated from [4]

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
